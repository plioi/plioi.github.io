title: Seamless Delegate Type Casting

<p>In <a href="http://patrick.lioi.net/2011/10/28/seamless-generic-type-casting/">Seamless Generic Type Casting</a>, we saw how the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> keywords can make our generic interfaces polite with respect to casting. A <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> can be treated as an <code>IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;</code> because a) all strings are objects and b) <code>IEnumerable</code> is declared with the <code>out</code> keyword. Now, we'll see how these keywords can be applied to delegate types in addition to interface types.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a a basic hierarchy of entity classes:</p>

<p>Also, suppose we find ourselves creating/persisting many instances of these in our integration tests, and we create a delegate type with some helper methods for doing so:</p>
<p>{% gist 1339379 %}</p>
<p>In our integration tests, we may use this to quickly get some sample employees into our database:</p>
<p>{% gist 1339417 %}</p>
<p>As we write some tests, we realize that we need some of our sample employees to be populated differently:</p>
<p>{% gist 1339420 %}</p>
<p>Surprise! This won't even compile. The compiler can't assign our <code>EntityCreator&lt;SalesPerson&gt;</code> to the expected type <code>EntityCreator&lt;Employee&gt;</code>. That's strange, since we know that any <code>SalesPerson</code> it ever makes will <strong>obviously</strong> be an Employee. As we saw with similar situations around interfaces, we need to use the <code>out</code> keyword when we define the delegate type, promising to the compiler that the <code>T</code> will only appear in the return value. Armed with this additional promise, the compiler can safely treat all <code>EntityCreator&lt;FieldTechnician&gt;</code> as <code>EntityCreator&lt;Employee&gt;</code>. With the following change, the example compiles as expected:</p>
